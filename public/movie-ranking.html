<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO DAVID</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Woman King</h3>
<p> 
This movie according to me teaches five virtues: <br>
Courage and resilience are essential in the face of oppression and hardship. <br>

Sisterhood and unity empower women to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. <br>

Challenging tradition is necessary to forge a more just and compassionate future. <br>

Leadership is earned through integrity, strength, and service to others. <br>

Freedom and identity are worth fighting for, even when it means defying powerful systems.

<h3>The Man Called God</h3>

<p>
My Five Key Lessons: <br>
Revenge has costs-Kang‑ta’s single‑minded pursuit of vengeance against his parents’ killers ultimately isolates him, costing the life of someone he loves and reminding us that vindictive desire often consumes more than it heals <br>

Even a “god‑like” hero is still human-Although he’s portrayed with superhuman skills and resources, Kang‑ta experiences pain, loss, and betrayal, illustrating that no one is truly invulnerable. <br>

Love challenges purpose-His growing bond with Bo‑bae forces him to reconsider the morality of his revenge mission. Genuine connection can disrupt even the most firm convictions <br>


Power and corruption link easily-As Kang‑ta infiltrates Han Kang‑suk’s empire, he confronts a world built on loyalty, ambition, and calculated violence. Even righteous warriors can confront moral decay when trapped in structures of power <br>


Redemption demands sacrifice-Toward the end, Kang‑ta chooses moments of peace over continued conflict. His transformation suggests that redemption isn’t found in vengeance, but in embracing community, forgiveness, and living beyond hatred. <br>

<h3>Minari (2020)</h3>
<p>
    Reasons: <br>
It's gentle, deeply human, and emotionally rich. <br>

It explores identity, belonging, and family with warmth and honesty. <br>

The performances (especially by Youn Yuh-jung and Steven Yeun) are heartfelt and authentic.<br>

It shows resilience and love even in life’s quiet, difficult moments. <br>
